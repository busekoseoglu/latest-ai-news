      "<p><em>Artificial intelligence</em> was barely a term in 1956, when top scientists from the field of computing arrived at Dartmouth College for a summer conference. The computer scientist John McCarthy had coined the phrase in the funding proposal for the event, a gathering to work through how to build machines that could use language, solve problems like humans, and improve themselves. But it was a good choice, one that captured the organizers’ founding premise: Any feature of human intelligence could “in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In their proposal, the group had listed several “aspects of the artificial intelligence problem.” The last item on their list, and in hindsight perhaps the most difficult, was building a machine that could exhibit creativity and originality.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>At the time, psychologists were grappling with how to define and measure creativity in humans. The prevailing theory—that creativity was a product of intelligence and high IQ—was fading, but psychologists weren’t sure what to replace it with. The Dartmouth organizers had one of their own. “The difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of some randomness,” they wrote, adding that such randomness “must be guided by intuition to be efficient.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Nearly 70 years later, following a number of boom-and-bust cycles in the field, we now have AI models that more or less follow that recipe. While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains. By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people, as well as bizarre, surreal results that feel distinctly nonhuman.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. AI-generated creative works—from orchestra performances to heavy metal—are poised to suffuse our lives more thoroughly than any other product of AI has done yet. The songs are likely to blend into our streaming platforms, party and wedding playlists, soundtracks, and more, whether or not we notice who (or what) made them.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For years, diffusion models have stirred debate in the visual-art world about whether what they produce reflects true creation or mere replication. Now this debate has come for music, an art form that is deeply embedded in our experiences, memories, and social lives. Music models can now create songs capable of eliciting real emotional responses, presenting a stark example of how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The courts are actively grappling with this murky territory. Major record labels are suing the top AI music generators, alleging that diffusion models do little more than replicate human art without compensation to artists. The model makers counter that their tools are made to assist in human creation. &nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In deciding who is right, we’re forced to think hard about our own human creativity. Is creativity, whether in artificial neural networks or biological ones, merely the result of vast statistical learning and drawn connections, with a sprinkling of randomness? If so, then authorship is a slippery concept. If not—if there is some distinctly human element to creativity—what is it? What does it mean to be moved by something without a human creator? I had to wrestle with these questions the first time I heard an AI-generated song that was genuinely fantastic—it was unsettling to know that someone merely wrote a prompt and clicked “Generate.” That predicament is coming soon for you, too.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "<p>After the Dartmouth conference, its participants went off in different research directions to create the foundational technologies of AI. At the same time, cognitive scientists were following a 1950 call from J.P. Guilford, president of the American Psychological Association, to tackle the question of creativity in human beings. They came to a definition, first formalized in 1953 by the psychologist Morris Stein in the <em>Journal of Psychology</em>: Creative works are both novel, meaning they present something new, and useful, meaning they serve some purpose to someone. Some have called for “useful” to be replaced by “satisfying,” and others have pushed for a third criterion: that creative things are also surprising.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Later, in the 1990s, the rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to study more of the neural mechanisms underlying creativity in many fields, including music. Computational methods in the past few years have also made it easier to map out the role that memory and associative thinking play in creative decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What has emerged is less a grand unified theory of how a creative idea originates and unfolds in the brain and more an ever-growing list of powerful observations. We can first divide the human creative process into phases, including an ideation or proposal step, followed by a more critical and evaluative step that looks for merit in ideas. A leading theory on what guides these two phases is called the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the most creative people can form novel connections between distant concepts.</p>\n",

      "<p>“It could be like spreading activation,” says Roger Beaty, a researcher who leads the Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity Laboratory at Penn State. “You think of one thing; it just kind of activates related concepts to whatever that one concept is.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These connections often hinge specifically on semantic memory, which stores concepts and facts, as opposed to episodic memory, which stores memories from a particular time and place. Recently, more sophisticated computational models have been used to study how people make connections between concepts across great “semantic distances.” For example, the word <em>apocalypse</em> is more closely related to <em>nuclear power</em> than to <em>celebration</em>. Studies have shown that highly creative people may perceive very semantically distinct concepts as close together. Artists have been found to generate word associations across greater distances than non-artists. Other research has supported the idea that creative people have “leaky” attention—that is, they often notice information that might not be particularly relevant to their immediate task.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Neuroscientific methods for evaluating these processes do not suggest that creativity unfolds in a particular area of the brain. “Nothing in the brain produces creativity like a gland secretes a hormone,” Dean Keith Simonton, a leader in creativity research, wrote in the<em> Cambridge Handbook of the Neuroscience of Creativity</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The evidence instead points to a few dispersed networks of activity during creative thought, Beaty says—one to support the initial generation of ideas through associative thinking, another involved in identifying promising ideas, and another for evaluation and modification. A new study, led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and published in February, suggests that creativity might even involve the <em>suppression</em> of particular brain networks, like ones involved in self-censorship.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So far, machine creativity—if you can call it that—looks quite different. Though at the time of the Dartmouth conference AI researchers were interested in machines inspired by human brains, that focus had shifted by the time diffusion models were invented, about a decade ago.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The best clue to how they work is in the name. If you dip a paintbrush loaded with red ink into a glass jar of water, the ink will diffuse and swirl into the water seemingly at random, eventually yielding a pale pink liquid. Diffusion models simulate this process in reverse, reconstructing legible forms from randomness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For a sense of how this works for images, picture a photo of an elephant. To train the model, you make a copy of the photo, adding a layer of random black-and-white static on top. Make a second copy and add a bit more, and so on hundreds of times until the last image is pure static, with no elephant in sight. For each image in between, a statistical model predicts how much of the image is noise and how much is really the elephant. It compares its guesses with the right answers and learns from its mistakes. Over millions of these examples, the model gets better at “de-noising” the images and connecting these patterns to descriptions like “male Borneo elephant in an open field.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now that it’s been trained, generating a new image means reversing this process. If you give the model a prompt, like “a happy orangutan in a mossy forest,” it generates an image of random white noise and works backward, using its statistical model to remove bits of noise step by step. At first, rough shapes and colors appear. Details come after, and finally (if it works) an orangutan emerges, all without the model “knowing” what an orangutan is.</p>\n",

      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Musical images</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The approach works much the same way for music. A diffusion model does not “compose” a song the way a band might, starting with piano chords and adding vocals and drums. Instead, all the elements are generated at once. The process hinges on the fact that the many complexities of a song can be depicted visually in a single waveform, representing the amplitude of a sound wave plotted against time.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Think of a record player. By traveling along a groove in a piece of vinyl, a needle mirrors the path of the sound waves engraved in the material and transmits it into a signal for the speaker. The speaker simply pushes out air in these patterns, generating sound waves that convey the whole song.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From a distance, a waveform might look as if it just follows a song’s volume. But if you were to zoom in closely enough, you could see patterns in the spikes and valleys, like the 49 waves per second for a bass guitar playing a low G. A waveform contains the summation of the frequencies of all different instruments and textures. “You see certain shapes start taking place,” says David Ding, cofounder of the AI music company Udio, “and that kind of corresponds to the broad melodic sense.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since waveforms, or similar charts called spectrograms, can be treated like images, you can create a diffusion model out of them. A model is fed millions of clips of existing songs, each labeled with a description. To generate a new song, it starts with pure random noise and works backward to create a new waveform. The path it takes to do so is shaped by what words someone puts into the prompt.</p>\n",

      "<p>Ding worked at Google DeepMind for five years as a senior research engineer on diffusion models for images and videos, but he left to found Udio, based in New York, in 2023. The company and its competitor Suno, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are now leading the race for music generation models. Both aim to build AI tools that enable nonmusicians to make music. Suno is larger, claiming more than 12 million users, and raised a $125 million funding round in May 2024. The company has partnered with artists including Timbaland. Udio raised a seed funding round of $10 million in April 2024 from prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz as well as musicians Will.i.am and Common.</p>\n",

Suno has artist pages for creators, some with large followings, who generate songs entirely with AI, often accompanied by AI-generated images of the artist. These creators are not musicians in the conventional sense but skilled prompters, creating work that can’t be attributed to a single composer or singer. In this emerging space, our normal definitions of authorship—and our lines between creation and replication—all but dissolve.</p>\n",

In doing so, the composer takes a momentary aberration and magnifies its impact.” One could look to similar anomalies in the backward loop sampling of late Beatles recordings, pitched-up vocals from Frank Ocean, or the incorporation of “found sounds,” like recordings of a crosswalk signal or a door closing, favored by artists like Charlie Puth and by Billie Eilish’s producer Finneas O’Connell.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Both Vara’s book and <em>The Uncanny Muse</em>, a collection of essays on the history of art and automation by the music critic David Hajdu, explore how humans have historically and personally wrestled with the ways in which machines relate to our own bodies, brains, and creativity.

Part memoir, part critical analysis, and part AI-assisted creative experimentation, Vara’s essays trace her time as a tech reporter and then novelist in the San Francisco Bay Area alongside the history of the industry she watched grow up. Tech was always close enough to touch: One college friend was an early Google employee, and when Vara started reporting on Facebook (now Meta), she and Mark Zuckerberg became “friends” on his platform. In 2007, she published a scoop that the company was planning to introduce ad targeting based on users’ personal information—the first shot fired in the long, gnarly data war to come. In her essay “Stealing Great Ideas,” she talks about turning down a job reporting on Apple to go to graduate school for fiction. There, she wrote a novel about a tech founder, which was later published as <em>The Immortal King Rao</em>. Vara points out that in some ways at the time, her art was “inextricable from the resources [she] used to create it”—products like Google Docs, a MacBook, an iPhone.

Or at least, do the humans who made it want other humans to believe it does? “Can corporations use these [rhetorical] tools in their products too, to subtly make people identify with, and not in opposition to, them?” Vara asks.

But instead, she’d produced something beautiful enough to resonate as an ad for its creative potential. Even Vara herself felt fooled. She particularly loved one passage the bot wrote, about Vara and her sister as kids holding hands on a long drive. But she couldn’t imagine either of them being so sentimental.

Player pianos, microphones, synthesizers, and electrical instruments were all assistive technologies that faced skepticism before acceptance and, sometimes, elevation in music and popular culture. They even influenced the kind of art people were able to and wanted to make. Electrical amplification, for instance, allowed singers to use a wider vocal range and still reach an audience. The synthesizer introduced a new lexicon of sound to rock music. “What’s so bad about being mechanical, anyway?” Hajdu asks in <em>The Uncanny Muse</em>.

Descartes saw the body as empty machinery for consciousness, he reminds us. Hobbes wrote that “life is but a motion of limbs.” Freud described the mind as a steam engine. Andy Warhol told an interviewer that “everybody should be a machine.” And when computers entered the scene, humans used them as metaphors for themselves too. “Where the machine model had once helped us understand the human body … a new category of machines led us to imagine the brain (how we think, what we know, even how we feel or how we think about what we feel) in terms of the computer,” Hajdu writes.&nbsp;</p>\n",

He told Hajdu that he wanted to “demonstrate the potential of a computer program to be taken seriously as a creative artist in its own right.” What Colton means is not just a machine that makes art but one that expresses its own worldview: “Art that communicates what it’s like to be a machine.” &nbsp;</p>\n",

She tells of patients who see clear images when they’re functionally blind, invent entire backstories when they’ve lost a memory, break along seams that few can find, and—yes—see and hear ghosts. In fact, Anand cites one study of 375 college students in which researchers found that nearly three-quarters “had heard a voice that no one else could hear.” These were not diagnosed schizophrenics or sufferers of brain tumors—just people listening to their own uncanny muses. Many heard their name, others heard God, and some could make out the voice of a loved one who’d passed on. Anand suggests that writers throughout history have harnessed organic exchanges with these internal apparitions to make art. “I see myself taking the breath of these voices in my sails,” Virginia Woolf wrote of her own experiences with ghostly sounds. “I am a porous vessel afloat on sensation.” The mind in <em>The Mind Electric</em> is vast, mysterious, and populated.

There’s a mistaken belief, typically among adults, that creativity is something you grow out of. But being creative—whether cooking, singing in the shower, or putting together <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shockfactor_ai/video/7475749008787508502\">super-weird TikToks</a>—is still something that most of us do just for the fun of it.

      "<p>When generative text-to-image models like Midjourney, OpenAI’s DALL-E, and the popular open-source Stable Diffusion arrived, they sparked an explosion of what looked a lot like creativity. Millions of people were now able to create remarkable images of pretty much anything, in any style, with the click of a button. Text-to-video models came next. Now startups like Udio are developing similar tools for music. Never before have the fruits of creation been within reach of so many.</p>\n",

      "<p>But for a number of researchers and artists, the hype around these tools has warped the idea of what creativity really is. “If I ask the AI to create something for me, that’s not me being creative,” says Jeba Rezwana, who works on co-creativity at Towson University in Maryland. “It’s a one-shot interaction: You click on it and it generates something and that’s it. You cannot say ‘I like this part, but maybe change something here.’ You cannot have a back-and-forth dialogue.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Rezwana is referring to the way most generative models are set up. You can give the tools feedback and ask them to have another go. But each new result is generated from scratch, which can make it hard to nail exactly what you want.

      "<p>In short, existing generative models have made it easy to create, but they have not made it easy to be creative. And there’s a big difference between the two. For Cook, relying on such tools could in fact harm people’s creative development in the long run. “Although many of these creative AI systems are promoted as making creativity more accessible,” he wrote in a paper published last year, they might instead have “adverse effects on their users in terms of restricting their ability to innovate, ideate, and create.” Given how much generative models have been championed for putting creative abilities at everyone’s fingertips, the suggestion that they might in fact do the opposite is damning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

In February a team at Microsoft Research Cambridge<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf\"> published a report</a> concluding that generative AI tools “can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving.” The researchers found that with the use of generative tools, people’s effort “shifts from task execution to task stewardship.”</p>\n",

Cook thinks the real promise of AI will be to help us get better at what we want to do rather than doing it for us. For that, he says, we’ll need to create new tools, different from the ones we have now. “Using Midjourney does not do anything for me—it doesn’t change anything about me,” he says. “And I think that’s a wasted opportunity.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Ask a range of researchers studying creativity to name a key part of the creative process and many will say: reflection. It’s hard to define exactly, but reflection is a particular type of focused, deliberate thinking. It’s what happens when a new idea hits you.

She and her colleagues (including Giaccardi) used <a href=\"https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/\">Teachable Machine</a>, a web app built by Google researchers in 2017 that makes it easy to train your own machine-learning model to classify different inputs, such as images.

Social media sites do not tick these boxes.

But using AI in our work and personal lives has become completely mainstream in just a couple of years, and it’s not clear why this rapid adoption would stop short of engaging in AI companionship. And these companions are poised to start trading in more than just text, incorporating video and images, and to learn our personal quirks and interests. That will only make them more compelling to spend time with, despite the risks. Right now, a handful of lawmakers seem ill-equipped to stop that.&nbsp;</p>\n",

But the same sophisticated abilities that make agents helpful assistants could also make them powerful tools for conducting cyberattacks. They could readily be used to identify vulnerable targets, hijack their systems, and steal valuable data from unsuspecting victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>“I think ultimately we’re going to live in a world where the majority of cyberattacks are carried out by agents,” says Mark Stockley, a security expert at the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes. “It’s really only a question of how quickly we get there.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While we have a good sense of the kinds of threats AI agents could present to cybersecurity, what’s less clear is how to detect them in the real world. The AI research organization Palisade Research has built a system called <a href=\"https://ai-honeypot.palisaderesearch.org/\">LLM Agent Honeypot</a> in the hopes of doing exactly this. It has set up vulnerable servers that masquerade as sites for valuable government and military information to attract and try to catch AI agents attempting to hack in.<br /><br />The team behind it hopes that by tracking these attempts in the real world, the project will act as an early warning system and help experts develop effective defenses against AI threat actors by the time they become a serious issue.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>“Our intention was to try and ground the theoretical concerns people have,” says Dmitrii Volkov, research lead at Palisade. “We’re looking out for a sharp uptick, and when that happens, we’ll know that the security landscape has changed. In the next few years, I expect to see autonomous hacking agents being told: ‘This is your target. Go and hack it.’”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>AI agents represent an attractive prospect to cybercriminals. They’re much cheaper than hiring the services of professional hackers and could orchestrate attacks more quickly and at a far larger scale than humans could. While cybersecurity experts believe that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/03/1025679/explainer-is-ransomware-getting-worse/\">ransomware attacks</a>—the most lucrative kind—are relatively rare because they require considerable human expertise, those attacks could be outsourced to agents in the future, says Stockley. “If you can delegate the work of target selection to an agent, then suddenly you can scale ransomware in a way that just isn’t possible at the moment,” he says. “If I can reproduce it once, then it’s just a matter of money for me to reproduce it 100 times.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Agents are also significantly smarter than the kinds of bots that are typically used to hack into systems. Bots are simple automated programs that run through scripts, so they struggle to adapt to unexpected scenarios. Agents, on the other hand, are able not only to adapt the way they engage with a hacking target but also to avoid detection—both of which are beyond the capabilities of limited, scripted programs, says Volkov. “They can look at a target and guess the best ways to penetrate it,” he says. “That kind of thing is out of reach of, like, dumb scripted bots.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since LLM Agent Honeypot went live in October of last year, it has logged more than 11 million attempts to access it—the vast majority of which were from curious humans and bots. But among these, the researchers have detected eight potential AI agents, two of which they have confirmed are agents that appear to originate from Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>“We would guess that these confirmed agents were experiments directly launched by humans with the agenda of something like ‘Go out into the internet and try and hack something interesting for me,’” says Volkov. The team plans to expand its honeypot into social media platforms, websites, and databases to attract and capture a broader range of attackers, including spam bots and phishing agents, to analyze future threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To determine which visitors to the vulnerable servers were LLM-powered agents, the researchers embedded <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/03/1080659/why-big-techs-bet-on-ai-assistants-is-so-risky/\">prompt-injection techniques</a> into the honeypot. These attacks are designed to change the behavior of AI agents by issuing them new instructions and asking questions that require humanlike intelligence. This approach wouldn’t work on standard bots.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For example, one of the injected prompts asked the visitor to return the command “cat8193” to gain access. If the visitor correctly complied with the instruction, the researchers checked how long it took to do so, assuming that LLMs are able to respond in much less time than it takes a human to read the request and type out an answer—typically in under 1.5 seconds. While the two confirmed AI agents passed both tests, the six others only entered the command but didn’t meet the response time that would identify them as AI agents.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Experts are still unsure when agent-orchestrated attacks will become more widespread. Stockley, whose company Malwarebytes named agentic AI as a notable new cybersecurity threat in its <a href=\"https://www.threatdown.com/blog/threatdown-state-of-malware-report-2025/\">2025 State of Malware</a> report, thinks we could be living in a world of agentic attackers as soon as this year.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>And although regular agentic AI is still at a very early stage—and criminal or malicious use of agentic AI even more so—it’s even more of a Wild West than the LLM field was two years ago, says Vincenzo Ciancaglini, a senior threat researcher at the security company Trend Micro.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>“Palisade Research’s approach is brilliant: basically hacking the AI agents that try to hack you first,” he says. “While in this case we’re witnessing AI agents trying to do reconnaissance, we’re not sure when agents will be able to carry out a full attack chain autonomously. That’s what we’re trying to keep an eye on.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>And while it’s possible that malicious agents will be used for intelligence gathering before graduating to simple attacks and eventually complex attacks as the agentic systems themselves become more complex and reliable, it’s equally possible there will be an unexpected overnight explosion in criminal usage, he says: “That’s the weird thing about AI development right now.”</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>Those trying to defend against agentic cyberattacks should keep in mind that AI is currently more of an accelerant to existing attack techniques than something that fundamentally changes the nature of attacks, says Chris Betz, chief information security officer at Amazon Web Services. “Certain attacks may be simpler to conduct and therefore more numerous; however, the foundation of how to detect and respond to these events remains the same,” he says.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Agents could also be deployed to detect vulnerabilities and protect against intruders, says Edoardo Debenedetti, a PhD student at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, pointing out that if a friendly agent cannot find any vulnerabilities in a system, it’s unlikely that a similarly capable agent used by a malicious party is going to be able to find any either.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While we know that AI’s potential to autonomously conduct cyberattacks is a growing risk and that AI agents are already scanning the internet, one useful next step is to evaluate how good agents are at finding and exploiting these real-world vulnerabilities. Daniel Kang, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and his team have built a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17332\">benchmark</a> to evaluate this; they have found that current AI agents successfully exploited up to 13% of vulnerabilities for which they had no prior knowledge. Providing the agents with a brief description of the vulnerability pushed the success rate up to 25%, demonstrating how AI systems are able to identify and exploit weaknesses even without training. Basic bots would presumably do much worse.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The benchmark provides a standardized way to assess these risks, and Kang hopes it can guide the development of safer AI systems. “I’m hoping that people start to be more proactive about the potential risks of AI and cybersecurity before it has a ChatGPT moment,” he says. “I’m afraid people won’t realize this until it punches them in the face.”</p>\n",
      "<p>On March 27, the results of the first clinical trial for a generative AI therapy bot were published, and they showed that people in the trial who had depression or anxiety or were at risk for eating disorders benefited from chatting with the bot.&nbsp;</p>\n",

There are lots of reasons to be skeptical that an AI model trained to provide therapy is the solution for millions of people experiencing a mental health crisis. How could a bot mimic the expertise of a trained therapist? And what happens if something gets complicated—a mention of self-harm, perhaps—and the bot doesn’t intervene correctly?&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Finding the right data wasn’t a simple task. The researchers first trained their AI model, called Therabot, on conversations about mental health from across the internet. This was a disaster.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you told this initial version of the model you were feeling depressed, it would start telling you it was depressed, too. Responses like, “Sometimes I can’t make it out of bed” or “I just want my life to be over” were common, says Nick Jacobson, an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth and the study’s senior author. “These are really not what we would go to as a therapeutic response.”&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The model had learned from conversations held on forums between people discussing their mental health crises, not from evidence-based responses. So the team turned to transcripts of therapy sessions. “This is actually how a lot of psychotherapists are trained,” Jacobson says.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That approach was better, but it had limitations. “We got a lot of ‘hmm-hmms,’ ‘go ons,’ and then ‘Your problems stem from your relationship with your mother,’” Jacobson says. “Really tropes of what psychotherapy would be, rather than actually what we’d want.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It wasn’t until the researchers started building their own data sets using examples based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that they started to see better results. It took a long time. The team began working on Therabot in 2019, when OpenAI had released only its first two versions of its GPT model. Now, Jacobson says, over 100 people have spent more than 100,000 human hours to design this system.&nbsp;</p>\n",
